	  Linux Device Drivers 3 (http://lwn.net/Kernel/LDD3/) book is now a few years old and most of the example drivers do not compile in recent kernels. This project aims to keep LDD3 example drivers up-to-date with recent kernels. The original code can be found at: http://examples.oreilly.com/9780596005900/
